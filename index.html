	<h1>Welcome to the Game of War!</h1>
	<h2>In order to play, click the 'Flip Card' button. At that point, the computer will deal out 26 cards face down to both players. Click the 'Flip Card' button again to battle the other player by flipping a card face up at the same time as the other player. The player with the highest value card wins. If the players' cards have equal value then both players will lay three more cards face down followed by one card face up. The player with the highest value card wins. If both players lay equal value cards again then "War" will continue until a player has a higher value card or one player runs out of cards.</h2>
