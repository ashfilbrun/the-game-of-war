	<h1>Welcome to the Game of War!</h1>
	<h2>In order to play, click the "Flip Card" button. At that point, 26 cards will be dealt face down to each player. Click the "Flip Card" button again to battle the other player by revealing a card face up simultaneously with the other player. The player with the highest value card wins the round. If both players cards have equal value then "War" will be triggered and both players will lay three more cards face down on their "Hostages" piles followed by one card face up on their discard piles. The player with the highest value card wins. If both players lay equal value cards again, then "War" will be triggered once more. Like before, the player with the highest value card wins. Game play ends and a winner is declared when either the computer or the player runs out of cards. At this point, the player can restart the game by hitting the "Reset Game" button to play again.</h2>
