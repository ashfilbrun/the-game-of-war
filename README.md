**Your gameâ€™s title**: A description of your game. Background info about why you chose the game is a nice touch.

The game I created is a version of the classic card game "War". I chose this game because as a kid I loved playing this game with my friends at school and I thought it would be a good challenge for me to remake a web version of it.
