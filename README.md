The Game of War!

The game I created is a version of the classic card game "War". I chose this game because as a kid I loved playing this game with my friends at school and I thought it would be a good challenge for me to remake a web version of it.

In order to play, click the "Flip Card" button. At that point, 26 cards will be dealt face down to each player. Click the "Flip Card" button again to battle the other player by revealing a card face up simultaneously with the other player. The player with the highest value card wins the round. If both players cards have equal value then "War" will be triggered and both players will lay three more cards face down on their "Hostages" piles followed by one card face up on their discard piles. The player with the highest value card wins. If both players lay equal value cards again, then "War" will be triggered once more. Like before, the player with the highest value card wins. Game play ends and a winner is declared when either the computer or the player runs out of cards. At this point, the player can restart the game by hitting the "Reset Game" button to play again.

**Getting Started**: Include a link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.
